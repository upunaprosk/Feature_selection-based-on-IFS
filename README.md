# Feature_selection via intuitionistic fuzzy sets

This repository contains an implementation of the method for feature selection, demonstrated in [1].  
Intuitionistic fuzzy sets are built for each attribute and, then, a quantitative characteristic is computed for further ranking of features.Detailed discription of the method and interpretation of the results is presented in ipynb file.<a href="https://githubtocolab.com/upunaprosk/Feature_selection-based-on-IFS/blob/main/IFS_algorithm.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in Colab"/></a>
